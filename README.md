# Dynamic-Sorting-Visualization
# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visualizer for various sorting algorithms using the Tkinter library for GUI. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work, allowing users to see the steps taken by each algorithm to sort an array of numbers.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

Each algorithm is visually represented, showing the comparisons, swaps, and the state of the array throughout the sorting process.
